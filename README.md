# Data Science Project - Falcon 9 launches

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 mn dollars. Other providers cost upwards of 165 mn dollars each, much of the savings are related to fact that SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 

The objective of this project was to predict if and under which conditions Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. 

If it can be determined whether the first stage will land, the cost of a launch can be determined. 

This information can be used by an alternate company that considers to bid against SpaceX.
